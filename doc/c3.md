## 3.2 Application/Product help
There are some visual cues on our website that help the user navigation. One of them is on Mobile Resolution in the "Blog" page that has a cursor that indicates the user to click on the post to activate the animation and show the post description. Also, the usage of tooltips is present on the "Forests" page, which indicates the name of the fields that are represented in icons. On the "Inquiry" page, all the form inputs have placeholders to indicate what they represent. The rest of the website was designed in a simplistic way to help the user in all resolutions formats without having an obligation to put an indication.
