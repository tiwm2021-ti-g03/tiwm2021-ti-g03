            The United Nations Environment Program, UNEP, advocates the conservation and restoration of forests on a large scale as a way of combating large forest fires. According to him, active replanting should be a focus on restoring the forest landscape in areas subject to fire. In the Algarve region of Portugal, for example, a project aims to recreate belts of native, fire-resistant cork oaks between more flammable commercial plantations of eucalyptus and pine. 
            For the UN(ONU) agency, “Portugal is also an example of how reducing the risk of fire can mean restoring the economic and social fabric of entire regions.” The agency highlights the country's new national fire management plan, which groups together natural and social restoration as one of its five pillars. United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) wildfire expert Peter Moore says “more people need to take an interest in restoring and managing these landscapes, and more support from governments and businesses is needed."

            Forest Sons already help a lot Portugal Environment, but the world is not just our country.
            We decided that our community is prepared to take a further step in that important mission: make the world a cleaner place.
            In order to start with it, a tour around the world would start on March 1st, 2022 and end on June 1st, 2022. We are going to clean up all the forests as much as we can and help other countries and volunteer forest companies that need our help.
            In the end, the world and humans gain from this, and to do that, we need your help. Do you want to be part of this mission? Be part of it by filling in our inquiry.
