## ForestSons
* * *
Repository to host the project developed for Internet Technologies, a first year subject at Intituto Politécnico da Maia - IPMAIA. Developed by [João Freitas](https://github.com/joaofreitas04) and [Dário Costa Alves](https://github.com/DarioCostaAlves)

## Project Theme Description
* * *
<div align="justify">
  The proposed theme of this practical work is to build a website related to "Forests". As a subtopic of this theme, it was decided to build a website for volunteering to support Portugal's forests. The objective is to create a community that wants to clean up those forests, helping our environment while at the same time having fun socializing and making the world a better place. ForestSons website starts with a "trunk of a tree" (homepage) that take you to all the ramifications of it (remaining pages). The homepage will contain important information, like individual or collective objectives, and a brief description of other pages. One of the pages, "Forests", will contain a list of all the forests that the community has already cleaned. Past and future events, news about the community and useful information to be updated in "forest world" will be presented in a blog format page. Another page is the gallery,which will have some images or videos of the events, activities and moments to remember community goals or stories. The total weight of trash removed by the community will be shown to all the users and will have annual goals that will be an extra motivation for all the volunteers to reach that. An inquiry with some required fields to be a forest son will be available on our page too. Finally, our work and story are described in detail on the "Our Work" page.
